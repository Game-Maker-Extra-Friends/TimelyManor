  description: A neatly organised notebook with the name Samantha engraved inside
    the cover. She seemed to enjoy documenting her discoveries in the manor.
  content: "\u201CI\u2019m treasure hunting! Mum and Dad keep talking in secret about
    something strange happening under the house. Those loud noises at night, it has
    to be a beast, guarding a horde of treasure. I wonder who left it there? Cowboys?
    Maybe Pirates!? Or perhaps mediaeval knights, who left a DRAGON to protect their
    wealth! A dragon, just like the book I found!  I asked Ben to join me, but he
    won\u2019t come out of his room. He says he\u2019s too scared of the house and
    the noises at night.  He thinks something is going to eat him. I mean sure, I
    get scared every now and then, but every good adventurer has to learn when to
    put on a brave face.  Dad can\u2019t figure out the letters the house\u2019s
    last owner left them, but they don\u2019t seem too tricky to me. I took one from
    the pile, it had a bunch of riddles on it, but they weren\u2019t too hard. They
    led me around the house until I found a beautiful red book, stuck in the fireplace,
    with a dragon on the front! I tried to show dad, but he freaked out! He took
    the book, told me he was going to lock it up somewhere, then he threw all of
    the other letters into the fireplace!  Dad\u2019s being very uncooperative, but
    I can overcome this setback. It's going to be a lot harder to find my way into
    the basement without those riddles, but I\u2019m not going to let that stop me.
    I\u2019ll find that treasure, then we\u2019ll be rich beyond our wildest dreams!\u201D "
