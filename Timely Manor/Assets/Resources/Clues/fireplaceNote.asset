  description: "Scrawled up parchment coated in Dried blood stains. This must\u2019ve
    been hidden here for decades. The text contains sinister ramblings. Who could\u2019ve
    left this here?"
  content: "The note is covered in blood stains, and is barely legible.  \u201CTo
    the Detective who keeps slipping through time, poking his nose who doesn\u2019t
    belong. Turn back, now. There's nothing for you to find but tragedy. If you want
    to see another day outside of this manor, you\u2019ll leave while you still can.
    Otherwise, you\u2019ll regret the day you ever came here.\u201D "
