  description: A written transcript of a private conversation. Written hastily. One
    of the kids was eavesdropping on their parents.
  content: "A conversation has been hastily transcripted onto the piece of paper.
    The writer was eavesdropping on their parents, writing down their conversation.  
    Mum: It's been months Patrick! We can\u2019t keep telling the kids it's just
    the house settling. We all heard those voices last night, and that, screaming!
    And your outburst in front of the kids the other night didn\u2019t help things.
    For goodness sake Patrick, smashing up the floor? Benjamin hasn\u2019t slept
    right since!  Dad: What do you want me to do Marianne? The previous tenant isn\u2019t
    returning my calls and the police didn\u2019t find anything/ We don\u2019t even
    know if our house has a basement, let alone where the entrance is!  Mum: If there
    is something down there, someone down there, then you need to be able to protect
    us! To protect the kids!  Dad: That's why I bought this bloody thing didn\u2019t
    I? I\u2019m keeping it in the safe, the kids can\u2019t get to it. I\u2019m not
    going to let anything hurt my family!  (Mum and Dad said nothing for a few minutes) 
    Mum: Maybe we should move back. Patrick, the new job, the money, its nice. But
    this house is so far out of town and the kids miss their friends. And I can\u2019t
    spend anymore time in the garden alone, not while knowing that something could
    be out there.  (Dad pulled out a pile of papers)  Dad: I know this house is\u2026
    Well, it\u2019s weird, these letters from the last tennant don\u2019t make much
    sense. But I\u2019m figuring them out, slowly, I swear. Look at this one, he\u2019s
    saying something about five paintings, the names of each, they connect. But I
    don\u2019t understand what he means, there's only two paintings in the hallway? 
    (Mum whispered something under her breath. I couldn\u2019t hear what she said.) 
    (Dad stormed out of the house)\u201D  "
