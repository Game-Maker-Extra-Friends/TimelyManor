  description: A written transcript, written by an eavesdropping child. Their father
    seemed to be obsessed with the paintings, thanks to a series of strange notes
    that were left to him
  content: "A conversation has been hastily transcripted onto the piece of paper.
    The writer was eavesdropping on their parents, writing down their conversation.
    <br><br>  Mum: It's been months Patrick! We can\u2019t keep telling the kids
    it's just the house settling. We all heard those voices last night, and that,
    screaming! And your outburst in front of the kids the other night didn\u2019t
    help things. For goodness sake Patrick, smashing up the floor? Benjamin hasn\u2019t
    slept right since! <br><br>  Dad: What do you want me to do Marianne? The previous
    tenant isn\u2019t returning my calls and the police didn\u2019t find anything!
    We don\u2019t even know if our house has a basement, let alone where the entrance
    is! <br><br>  Mum: If there is something down there, someone down there, then
    you need to be able to protect us! To protect the kids! <br><br>  Dad: That's
    why I bought this bloody thing didn\u2019t I? I\u2019m keeping it in the safe,
    the kids can\u2019t get to it. I\u2019m not going to let anything hurt my family!
    <br><br>  (Mum and Dad said nothing for a few minutes) <br><br>  Dad: I know
    this house is\u2026 Well, it\u2019s weird, these letters from the last tennant
    don\u2019t make much sense. But I\u2019m figuring them out, slowly, I swear.
    Look at this one, he\u2019s saying something about five paintings, the names
    of each, they connect. But I don\u2019t understand what he means, there's only
    two paintings in the hallway? <br><br>  (Mum whispered something under her breath.
    I couldn\u2019t hear what she said.) <br><br>  (Dad stormed out of the house)
    <br><br> "
