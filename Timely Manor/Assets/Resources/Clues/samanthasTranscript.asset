  description: A written transcript, written by an eavesdropping child. Their father
    seemed to be obsessed with the paintings, thanks to a series of strange notes
    that were left to him
  content: "A conversation has been hastily written onto the piece of paper. The
    writer was eavesdropping on their parents.<br><br>  Mum: For goodness sake Patrick!
    Have you gone insane? What are we supposed to tell the kids now? Not after what
    we heard last night.<br><br>  Dad: It\u2019s better that they don\u2019t know!
    I\u2019ll figure something out. There has to be a clue within these letters from
    the previous tenant. Look at this one,<b> \u201CThe five paintings and letters
    will reveal the truth\u201D.</b> The letters keep mentioning five, and yet there
    are only two that I can see. How does this all connect? <br><br>  Mum: Stop wasting
    your time on these crazy ramblings and focus on your family!<br><br>  (The conversation
    ended there, Mum left the room and went upstairs while Dad just stayed reading
    the letters.) "
