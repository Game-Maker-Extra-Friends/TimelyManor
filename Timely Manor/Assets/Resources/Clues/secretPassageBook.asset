  description: A book that covers secret passages, aimed at younger audiences. Separated
    from the rest of the books, someone read through this recently.
  content: "\u201CTowards the end of the 18th century, hidden rooms and compartments
    became a craze amongst many aristocratic families. It\u2019s difficult to pin
    down when installation of such rooms began, due to the secrecy that surrounded
    them. <br><br>  Trades such as plumbing and carpentry offered installation services
    under a strict confidentiality agreement. The process typically consisted of
    hollowing out a structure on a side that wasn\u2019t visible, to make room for
    the desired hidden valuables. Nearby walls or floors were then kitted with moving
    parts to allow users to input an unlocking code. <br><br>  One unfortunate side
    effect of this process was the structural damage it caused over an extended period
    of time. The moving parts required to open the compartments often caused the
    foundations to decay at faster rates due to the hollowing process.\u201D "
