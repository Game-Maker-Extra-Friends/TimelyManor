  description: A barely legible diary entry from one of the missing teens, likely
    written while drunk. Joey seems to be quite concerned for his friend, who has
    been behaving strangely all night.
  content: "The note is mostly incoherent babbling. The author was likely quite intoxicated.
    <br><br>  \u201CJoeyy here Renovations! We smashed the wall! Me! Me AND Kabir!

    stains. "
