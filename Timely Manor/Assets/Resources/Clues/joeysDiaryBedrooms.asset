  description: "A diary entry from one of the missing teens. The writing is barely
    legible, the author must\u2019ve been quite intoxicated."
  content: "The party died down in the bedrooms. Christine was feeling sick, so her
    and Damon went outside. Kabir and Joey, still rowdy from the night, took to destroying
    one of the walls in the bedrooms, under the pretence of \u2018renovation.\u2019
    While this was happening, Delilah began acting very unusually, and began to paint
    some unusual markings on the wall. This concerned Joey, but he likely passed
    out before he could finish writing his notes."
