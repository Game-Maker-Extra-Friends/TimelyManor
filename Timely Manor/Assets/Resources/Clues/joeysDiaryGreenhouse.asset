  description: A diary entry from one of the missing teens. Recalls how they first
    found this abandoned manor
  content: "\u201CI didn\u2019t think Damon & Christine would EVER stop complaining,
    but we found it yo! The twins and I hopped off school a lil early to go find
    this place. They thought I was crazy! Talkin bout some big creepy empty building
    I found in the manor. But once we found the place, their jaws hit the floor! 
    I showed them my \u2018improvised\u2019 entrance, right through the shattered
    window. They\u2019re running around the house now, I can hear them stomping through
    the hallways. We just waitin\u2019 on Kabir and Delilah to bring the party stuff
    now. In the meantime, I\u2019m sketching a nice map o\u2019 the place. I got
    big plans for our new clubhouse here\u2026\u201D "
