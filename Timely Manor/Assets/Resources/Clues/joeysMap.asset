  description: These teens drew a map of the manor. Some rough renovation plans.
    They were planning on staying here for quite a while
  content: "One of the teenagers has drawn a map of the manor, labelling each room
    with a new purpose.  The Bedrooms have been renamed to \u201CThe Bar\u201D. Joey
    plans on removing the wall between the bedrooms to create one giant room where
    they keep all their drinks  The Greenhouse has been renamed to the \u201CFront
    Gate\u201D. Chrstine thinks they should make the hole in the window bigger and
    clear the broken glass, if they are going to continue using it as an entrance.  
    The Family Room has been renamed to \u201CThe Party Pad.\u201D Kabir wants to
    buy a portable generator, to set up lights and speakers. "
