  description: "Towards the end of the 18th century, hidden rooms and compartments
    became a craze amongst many aristocratic families. It\u2019s difficult to pin
    down when installation of such rooms began, due to the secrecy that surrounded
    them. Multiple theories have been offered as to what caused this sudden resurgence.
    Dr Benedict Francois believes the upper class were intended to hide property
    deeds and stashes of valuables in the wake of the civil war and the chaos that
    followed. Graham Yon instead argued that the rich man's need to protect their
    assets meant such devices were inevitable, and likely first appeared some decades
    prior.  Regardless of the origin and secrecy, word seemed to get around. Reports
    of lost riches and treasures rediscovered in the state of Charlington have flooded
    in over the past decade. Installation of these entrances varied greatly depending
    on the architecture of said home, but it was common practice to install switches
    into existing foundations, so visitors could not notice the difference. Stone
    and brick work, as well as wooden walls were most often used for these compartments.
    There are even reports of some families installing such compartments into their
    furniture.  Trades such as plumbing and carpentry offered installation services
    under a strict confidentiality agreement. The process typically consisted of
    hollowing out a structure on a side that wasn\u2019t visible, to make room for
    the desired hidden valuables. Nearby walls or floors were then kitted with moving
    parts to allow users to input an unlocking code.   One unfortunate side effect
    of this process was the structural damage it caused over an extended period of
    time. The moving parts required to open the compartments often caused the foundations
    to decay at faster rates due to the hollowing process. Families have reported
    discovering these compartments by searching for signs of damage within their
    home. Unfortunately, as many of these compartments are mere decades old at the
    time of writing, it will be a long time until this method becomes truly viable. "
